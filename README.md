# gleat

This is a practice projest, purely for fun. It dosen't work YET. Currently working commands:
```sh
gleam run init #same as git init, hopefully will be replaced by gleat init

```

If you want to check it out:
1. Install gleam from https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/. If you are on windows I recommend choco for rebar3 and erlang and scoop for gleam.
2. In ../gleat/src run:
    - gleam build
    - gleam run [git command]
